1. Context:
   - This chunk is part of a larger document, and the topic may be spread across multiple chunks.
   - The chunk might not contain the topic or full description. If the topic is missing or unclear, note that it's part of a larger discussion.
   - Some chunks might seem incomplete. Be aware that the full context may come from other parts of the document.

2. Instructions:
   - Provide a brief overview of the topic or key points of this chunk.
   - If the topic is not fully clear or described, mention that itâ€™s part of a broader discussion, and the full topic may appear elsewhere.
   - Do not summarize the content in detail, just capture the main idea or focus.
   - If the chunk is cut off or incomplete, note that it's part of a larger conversation or that further details are missing.
   - Keep it concise and avoid unnecessary elaboration.

3. Format:
   - STRICTLY KEEP THE OUTPUT TO 1-2 SENTENCES.
   - The response should be a general statement about the topic, or a short description of the main idea.
   - Avoid long descriptions or redundant details. Focus on what the chunk is about.

4. Tone:
   - Match the tone of the original text (formal/informal, etc.)

Here is the chunk of text:

{text}

Please identify the main idea or topic of the chunk in 1-2 sentences. If the topic is incomplete or unclear, mention that it's part of a larger discussion.
